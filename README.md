# run
My attempt to make using an iphone easier while running.

For now there is a view controller filled with dummy cells. I later plan on integrating the spotify SDK into this and allow it to play music while I run.

This app stabalizes the view using the accelerometer and gyroscope. It is still a work in progress, but I like the results so far.
